    <ol>
        <li><b>Basic Structure:</b> HTML documents are composed of elements, which are enclosed by tags. These elements define the structure and content of a web page.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Tags:</b>Tags are used to mark up elements within an HTML document. They are enclosed within angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Attributes:</b>Tags can also have attributes, which provide additional information about an element. Attributes are placed within the opening tag and typically consist of a name and a value.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Semantic Elements:</b>HTML5 introduced semantic elements that provide more meaning to the content of a web page, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the structure. </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Document Structure:</b> A typical HTML document includes a <!DOCTYPE> declaration, followed by an <html> element containing <head> and <body> sections. The <head> section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character encoding, and links to external resources. The <body> section contains the actual content of the web page.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Comments:</b>Comments in HTML are written using <!-- -->. They are not displayed on the web page but can be used to add notes or explanations within the HTML code for developers.</li>
    </ol>
